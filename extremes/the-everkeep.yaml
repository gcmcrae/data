    resolve: |
      This can be resolved by following the "Bagel strat". Party members will be given markers to stand on at the start of the instance pre-pull. The two tanks will typically take their stacks alone after popping heavy mit, and then slowly following the line as it travels south,
      with each party member following the line as it passes them. This allows for low-effort resolution.
